##Analysis of Clinical Trial Dataset using HiveQL on PySpark

The Clinical Dataset is a 2021 dataset by Mesh and Pharma.

I've answered questions such as;

-The number of studies in the dataset.

-The types of studies in the dataset and count of each type.

-The top 5 conditions with their frequency.

-The most frequent roots.

-The 10 most common sponsors that are not pharmaceutical companies.

-The number of completed studies each month in a given year.
